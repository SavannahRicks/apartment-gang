                <p><span>Physical Description:</span> Diana is a slightly below average height woman,
                with a surprisingly curvaceous figure despite her size. She has 2A type hair, with
                it being a golden blonde color. None of her roots end up showing ever as she grows
                older, so there are no dark roots. She has green eyes, almost candy apples in color.
                Her appearance changes as the time changes, but what never changes is her elegance
                and grace no matter what she looks like or what she wears. Diana used to have many
                freckles as a human, but her immortality erased them for an unknown reason. Diana
                also has the 3 birthmarks like Dio, but the positions are different. She has one on
                each ear, and one on her right shoulder. These birthmarks indicate Diana to be a
                very polite and giving person, who is very influential on others. Diana also has
                lower back dimples</p>
            <p><span>Clothing Description:</span> Diana’s outfits change based on the part, as well
                as her hairstyles </p>

        <p><span>Character Interactions:</span> how Diana has been seen and progressed throughout
            the series</p>
        <h4>Powers and Abilities:</h4>
        <p><span>Hamon User:</span> Yes | No</p>
        <p><span>Stand User: </span>Yes | No</p>
        <p><span>Namesake: </span>Pretty Young Thing- a Michael jackson song that connects to her
            name and her requiem ability reference</p>
        <h4>Stand Statistics:</h4>
        <p>(Rank the following statistics as: A: Excellent B: Good C: Average (can compare to a
            normal person) D: Weak E: Very Weak)</p>
        <p>Diana has a very interesting progression of her stands. She would end up developing a
            requiem ability, that allows her to take other peoples stands from them. Making her the
            polar opposite to a stand arrow. When being stabbed with the requiem arrow, it shattered
            into pieces, and each piece individually would implant itself inside of her. She has
            pieces in her throat, her wrists, her stomach, her spine, both legs and her ankles.
            These fragments will seemingly never leave her. </p>
