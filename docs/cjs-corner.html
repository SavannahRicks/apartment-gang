                    Farmer <br /> Backstory: Amos grew up on a farm for most of his life, tending to
                    animals and such. He was the definition of a country boy, and didn't go to
                    school but was homeschooled instead. When he started expanding the distribution
                    of his produce and products, he met his current partner, an octoling who runs a
                    bakery and diner. The two live apart, but commute often and make it a point to
                    go out when Amos comes over. He also deals with arthritis, which is dealt with
                    by medication and stretches.<br />

                    American<br /> Personality: Aloof, Sleepy<br /> Occupation: Baker, Diner
                    Chef<br /> Backstory: Cris had spent his childhood cooking and busying herself
                    around the house assisting his mother and enjoying the thrills of baking. Food
                    was a huge part of her life and continued to be as he nearly built up a career
                    before she delved into turfing. He used to be a star turf player, majoring in
                    Splatlings and Rollers for around a 20 year career before she eventually retired
                    to fully realize his cooking dreams. She met a lovely inkling who worked on a
                    farm and provided the raw ingredients for his bread, and the two fell in love.

                    Photojournalist<br /> Backstory: Bayou spent most of her school career messing
                    around with yearbook, not really paying much attention to her studies despite
                    her parents' complaints. She studied abroad for her Communications degree, and
                    ended up staying in Japan where the turf scene was hot. She joined a very
                    popular turfing magazine, working as both a photojournalist and an article
                    writer. Occasionally she comes back to the U.S. to visit, and sometimes brings
                    one or two of her turfing friends with her. Her sister is also of photo
                    journaling fame. She also deals with OCPD, which helps her to be driven, but
                    also hinders her from creating at times. </p>

                    Ethnicity: Italian, Filipino<br /> Personality: Kind, Attentive, Caring, Gentle,
                    Easily Swayed, Gullible<br /> Occupation: Actor/Musician<br /> Backstory: Harper
                    had been a part of a split family, with his mother and father splitting right
                    after he was born. He never knew the cause, but a lot of his anxiety came from
                    his own fear that he had caused it. His mother remarried to an octoling who
                    absolutely did not like him, and constantly berated him. He graduated high
                    school and immediately went into college. After going to college and starring in
                    a few of small film projects, he was picked up by a group of folks who were able
                    to get him into a few up-and-coming films, not knowing that one would be a huge
                    hit. Harper now works as a full time actor with a side thing as a songwriter.

                    Nonconfrontational<br /> Occupation: Higher Voices and Drums for "Shivers"<br />
                    Backstory: Arnon and Afra were born to an abusive mother and father who had them
                    after his mother had broken up with an, actually quite nice, octoling. She had
                    an older sibling who she didn't remember all too well, and so had a rather
                    uneventful childhood until her older sibling left. Afra and him were almost
                    entirely raised by their unnamed sibling, who proved to be a valuable force in
                    their lives and was the sole reason for them to do music in pursuit of traveling
                    the world. Arnon is fiercely protected by their twin, and the two of them are
                    currently in pursuit of finding their sibling while juggling their music career.

                    Backstory: Afra and Arnon were born to an abusive mother and an… actually nice
                    dad. They had an older sibling who they don't remember all too well, and so had

                    Extroverted, Peppy, Sheltered, Judgemental<br /> Occupation: "Influencer"<br />
                    Backstory: Tristen was born in Switzerland to two very successful movie
                    directors, who frequently left Tristen in the hands of a babysitter. Despite
                    their absences though, they tried to spend as much time as possible with them.
                    Tristen was a very happy and go-lucky child, frequently messing around with arts
                    and crafts and making decorations for the lavish home they lived in. After
                    entering school and joining the dance team there, they started using InkTok to
                    share their dances. Already making thousands, with a lot of that money coming
                    from their parents, Tristen was successful on InkTok and was considered to be
                    one of the very first influencers for the platform. They moved to California to
                    get closer to other opportunities for film or something similar, now living out
                    their days in luxury. They donate a lot of their money to different GoFundMe's
                    and randomly gives out thousands to their fans. </p>

                <p> Name: Adaline Kensa <br /> Age: 29<br /> Gender: Female (she/her)<br /> Height:
                    6'0<br /> Orientation: Lesbian<br /> Species: Inkling/Octoling<br /> Ethnicity:
                    French, Russian, Japanese<br /> Personality: Abrasive, Pessimistic, Polite, to
                    those who she thinks are worthy, Creative<br /> Occupation: Professional Ballet
                    Dancer <br /> Backstory: Adaline is the eldest of two siblings, making her Toni
                    and Ryo's first child. She was generally quiet and didn't make many friends
                    during her younger years, but slowly began to open up during high school. She
                    was interested in dancing, especially ballet, after her mother showed her some
                    videos about it and explained how important it was in their family's culture.
                    After much debate on what she wanted to do after high school, she begged her
                    parents to send her to France to one of the most prestigious ballet schools. Her
                    parents divorced around that time, and Toni started her gear business, which
                    gave Ada the funds to join. She spent her time rigorously training, and
                    eventually ending up doing it professionally. She is the supposed heir to the
                    Kensa brand, but her sibling seems to be the one who actually wants to take that
                    position. </p>

                    French, Russian, Japanese<br /> Personality: Kind, Quiet, Loving, Protective,
                    Optimistic<br /> Occupation: School Teacher<br /> Backstory: Kana was born to
                    Toni and Ryo, being their second and last child. Like her sister, she was
                    generally quiet, but saw the best out of people instead of the worst. She was
                    naturally inclined to taking care of others and helping, being described as a
                    homebody even before she finished high school. Through her work from home and
                    her parents, she eventually got her own house and immediately adopted 2 cats to
                    take care of. She got through college and graduated, becoming a school teacher
                    right out of classes. She soon met another teacher at the school and began
                    dating them, eventually having a child after working for about 5 years. After
                    having her child, the two split and Kana takes care of her child while her
                    parents help occasionally. </p>

                    Backstory: Goldie, as a small child, was always involved in some type of cooking
                    at his house. He fully intended on making it into a career, until he had to help
                    his family out of a bad spot by joining the Yakuza. His mother, Sang, did her
                    best not to disapprove, but worried greatly for his safety and frequently
                    attempted to check in with him. He had no contact with his sister during this
                    time either, so she stayed with their mother. He worked in his own little group
                    for many years, working up and paying off his debt until he could make his move.
                    In a moment of vulnerability where he was about to leave, one of his
                    subordinates attacked him and kicked him out, which tarnished his reputation. He
                    left, still, and started working for his culinary degree. He is coping with
                    previous generalized anxiety and persistent depression. </p>

                    Trying<br /> Occupation: Chef, Youtuber<br /> Backstory: Like her brother, Lan
                    was always into cooking during her childhood. She was a mama's girl, as Goldie
                    was a mama's boy, and the two gravitated towards their mother, Sang, in lieu of
                    their late father. Right out of highschool, she knew she wanted to go to
                    culinary school and make her passion into a job. She had tried to talk Goldie
                    out of getting into Yakuza, but he ended up going anyway and she eventually just
                    worked a second job while getting her education. She did not start her own
                    culinary business, but instead was hired out of college by a food magazine to
                    have her own show on the youtube channel. </p>

                    Songwriter<br /> Backstory: Lucine was a literal test tube baby, being a splice
                    between his mother's eggs and Zapfish DNA to see if something could be made out
                    of said hybrid. She is continuously monitored, though her mother is way too
                    absorbed in her other work that she was granted after this hybridization was a
                    success. He spent his time going to school, hanging out with a group dubbed the
                    "Loser's Club" after he joined, and made music. She works at a local record shop
                    while maintaining her underground music career. His style is reminiscent of Jack
                    Stauber, while visually it is a bit like Mason Lindroth. She shares an apartment
                    with Marsc, while Marz also frequently crashes at. </p>

                    Quiet, Goofy<br /> Occupation: Baking Apprentice<br /> Backstory: Mascarpone had
                    an ok childhood, but pretty shit parents who weren't around all too much. They
                    worked a job for a good majority of their childhood into adulthood, picking up
                    cooking as a skill and being particularly good at baking. They met Marz,
                    Carmine, and Lucine in high school and the four of them made up the "Loser's
                    Club," which still exists despite the distance. Marsc frequented a restaurant
                    run by an older octoling, and they applied to work there as a cook. The owner
                    was quite impressed with what quality of food they brought to the table, and so
                    asked them to work in the bakery as well. The owner took them under his wing and
                    the two work together frequently to come up with more baking ideas and entrees
                    for the diner. They share an apartment with their friend LUCINE. </p>

                    free time she is a fan of crocheting. She frequently is the logical half of the
                    recovery group, and uses her extended knowledge to keep them out of trouble. She
                    is also abnormally strong, something of which Alkali is very proud of. </p>

                    being a lead private investigator at a local firm, Sylva was essentially bred
                    and raised to be his successor. Keen deduction skills and attention to detail
                    were the highlights of its skillset and it was able to fly through school with a
                    year shaved off. She soon joined her father's firm and was doing simple
                    investigation's left and right until approached by a worried mother hoping to
                    get some answers for her son. He was soon found, but Sylva took it into its own
                    hands to do more research into the Yakuza and slowly retraced her previous
                    client's steps back to his Yakuza clan. Sylva continues to do research and poke
                    around in this organized crime group. </p>

                    Laidback, Relaxed<br /> Occupation: Yakuza Underling, Massage Therapist<br />
                    Backstory: Coming from an unknown planet, Xain is actually a special type of
                    extraterrestrial jellyfish humanoid. They can shapeshift at will and can release
                    a sort of relaxing pheromone that makes someone fall asleep instantaneously.
                    Said pheromone was supposed to be used to collect a host for the
                    extraterrestrial, but Xain did it only once and has never done it again. The
                    smell is unique to each alien, however, and Xain's scent has been dubbed to be
                    something akin to lemon meringue pie. He really doesn't care about "furthering
                    the species'' and literally only cares about his friends that he's made while
                    being a part of the Yakuza. She is good friends with Goldie, Lucien, and Sylva
                    and hangs out with the first two quite often. They tend to be an introvert and
                    don't get out all too much, but Lucien and Goldie enjoy dragging them out for
                    fun on the weekends. </p>

                    Occupation: Yakuza Boss<br /> Backstory: Born to caring, loving parents, but
                    didn't have much respect for authorities otherwise. Joined a sukeban group after
                    the leader decided she would make a good pickpocket. She got arrested and was
                    disowned by her family halfway during her last year of high school. She ignored
                    secondary education after she left, and joined the Yakuza after following the
                    sukeban's leader into organized crime. She was a part of a different group than
                    her former leader and stayed as a subordinate in the group until the leader
                    decided to discreetly leave, which gave her the opportunity to assert her
                    authority and take over as leader. Now sits as the leader, and continues to work
                    for the Yakuza. </p>

                    Ethnicity: French, Korean<br /> Personality: Bull-headed, Stubborn, Angry,
                    Introverted<br /> Occupation: Culinary/Fashion Student<br /> Backstory: Lucien's
                    life was absolutely perfect, with unconditional love from his parents and being
                    a popular kid at school. He thought his entire life was planned out and he would
                    be living it exactly as planned, but it derailed when he started going through
                    puberty. Things didn't feel right, he didn't like his name, and he soon grew
                    irritated and angry. He tried his best to contain himself, but after a
                    particularly bad outburst, he was sent to a private school to be disciplined.
                    There, he discovered a group of kids who were sent there by their bigoted
                    parents. Lucien originally had no clue what being LGBT+ was nor did he want to
                    learn, but one of the kids basically adopted him as the group introvert, and he
                    soon discovered what being trans was. He's been too scared to be fully upfront
                    with his transness, but he has found comfort among a friend group who is also
                    LGBT+. He met Goldie and Xain at the same time, and soon became friends despite
                    their differences. </p>

                    Jewish, Polish<br /> Personality: Happy, Chipper, Motherly, Caring<br />
                    Occupation: Professional Turfer<br /> Backstory: Sappho was from a rather caring
                    and loving home from two hippie mothers, who had her during the older parts of
                    their lives. She absolutely loves both of them to death, and early-on showed her
                    love for feminine things as she was raised gender neutral. Her mothers supported
                    her with their entire being, and she went through school without much trouble.
                    She was actually homeschooled with a modified curriculum, receiving a lot of
                    education about some unheard subjects that public school didn't bother teaching.
                    A majority of her schooling also allowed her to indulge in her turfing skill,
                    which her mothers also supported! Sappho eventually moved out and into a duplex
                    apartment, which she shares with her roommate Caesar. She had met him during a
                    few friendly scrims and the two actually hit it off, which was strange
                    considering how Caesar usually acted. </p>

                    Greek<br /> Personality: Aggressive, Bitchy, Unfriendly, Trying his Best<br />
                    Occupation: Professional Turfer<br /> Backstory: Caesar was… something else. As
                    a child, he heavily repressed his feelings he had for some of his male
                    classmates and it turned into rage. He was a very, very aggressive child due to
                    his repression and strictness that his family home had. He was the older brother
                    of two little siblings who he tried his best to take care of and keep safe, and
                    so he took the brunt of whatever abuse his parents doled out. When he turned 18,
                    he fled the coop immediately and started surfing couches until he met Sappho.
                    Sappho gladly allowed him in and helped to train him to be a successful turfer.
                    The two work as a pair usually, and they frequently are seen hanging around
                    together. Caesar is rather antisocial and doesn't have many friends, but Sappho
                    is fine to help. He messed around with a man he didn't end on the greatest terms
                    with either, but he tries his best not to let that stop him from being a bit
                    more outgoing. His unconscious mind made him rather aggressive towards those he
                    has crushes on/likes and it deters many possible friends. </p>

                    amazing feat of engineering to any foster home she was a part of. She was
                    eventually adopted by one of her foster parent pairs, two women by the names of
                    Zirconia and Aarya, who had their biological daughter as well. Foil continues to
                    get along well with her foster mothers and sister, visiting them weekly when her
                    schedule can manage. She started repairing and customizing weapons and gear
                    after she was permanently disabled from the left knee down during a pit fight,
                    which caused her to lose her turfing career as well. Although a bit bitter about
                    it, she has more than enough consistent cliente to have enough money to keep her
                    satisfied and able to indulge in her own collection of customized and vintage

                    live back in the states. They were rough and tumble in their school, not giving
                    a single fuck about what other people thought about them. Their parents were
                    absent more than anything, and so they foraged and worked a handful of odd jobs
                    to keep the house running. To blow steam off, they established themselves as a
                    derby player and allow themselves to grow stronger for their pit fighting. </p>

                <p> Name: Trixie Harley<br /> Age: 25<br /> Gender: Female (she/her)<br /> Height:
                    6'7<br /> Orientation: Lesbian<br /> Species: Colossal Inkling<br /> Ethnicity:
                    Native Neoamerican, Italian<br /> Personality: Laidback, Calm, Kind, Quiet<br />
                    Occupation: Farm Hand<br /> Backstory: Trixie originally was born to a native
                    father and a European mother, and the two divorced shortly after her birth.
                    Trixie lived with her father on the reservation of the tribe she was a part of,
                    and life was pretty normal from there. She was gladly given a nice farm by one
                    of her elders, to which her family moved onto it swiftly. She used it as an
                    opportunity to support her father and her family. She frequently rakes in money
                    from both selling raw materials from the farm and also crafts and handmade goods
                    that her family makes. Trixie eventually met a girl her age while she was
                    providing for her family. Her name was Tetra and the two developed a pretty
                    tight friendship, to which Trixie eventually started one-sidedly crushing on
                    her. She eventually was left alone when Tetra left to go pursue her modeling
                    career and Trixie continues to work on the farm that her family owns on the
                    reservation. </p>

                <p> Name: Dobry Banach<br /> Age: 21<br /> Gender: Nonbinary (they/it)<br /> Height:
                    6'4<br /> Orientation: Demi-Pansexual<br /> Species: Colossal Squid<br />
                    Ethnicity: Polish<br /> Backstory: Born with complete blindness, Dobry was
                    raised by a single mother who loved them with a passion. They were homeschooled
                    and frequently hung out with a local group of other blind denizens, learning
                    from others how to navigate the world and figure out how to live their life to
                    the fullest. They were given a seeing-eye sea lion by the group and love their
                    pup with a passion. Their lion's name is "Pip" and also works as their ESA,
                    helping to alleviate the crushing anxiety they deal with daily. Dobry discovered
                    their absolute apathy to gender after finally moving out of the house, and their
                    mother respected them immediately. Currently, Dobry is studying to be a
                    financial analyst as they have always had an interest in finances (no matter how
                    boring Abeba thinks it is). They share an apartment with Abeba, who they had met
                    over a dating app and although not hitting it off romantically, the two formed a
                    deep bond and had gotten a place together. Personality: Easygoing, Positive,
                    <br /> Occupation: Student (for Financials)<br />
